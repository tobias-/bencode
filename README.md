Bencode
=======

Encode and encode bencoded data

Usage
=====

I'm working on getting a release to maven central (especially nice for Groovy), but for now copy the source files into your repository. The groovy files are just copies of the java files.

Why
===

The code is a clean room implementation over 10 years old (April 2003), but cleaned up a little since then. 

It's most likely neither the fastest nor prettiest, but it's free as speech (BSD), not as beer (GPL).
