Bencode
=======

Encode and decode bencoded data

Usage
=====

The groovy files are just copies of the java files, so either copy the files, use grape
```@Grab('be.olsson.bencoder:bencoder:0.14')```

or any other framework here:
http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cbe.olsson.bencoder%7Cbencoder%7C0.14%7Cjar

Why
===

The code is a clean room implementation over 10 years old (April 2003), but cleaned up a little since then. 

It's most likely neither the fastest nor prettiest, but it's free as speech (BSD), not as beer (GPL).
